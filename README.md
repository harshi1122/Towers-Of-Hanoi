# Towers-Of-Hanoi
Towers of Hanoi game implemented using knowledge of Stacks

Recently there was a power cut in my area and without WiFi , life seemed so mundane
<br>That's when I realized I had this mini game Python file still pending
<br>I finished the rest of the code and spent a hour trying to solve a 7 number stack
<br>It was a good timepass

<br>The idea is to shift the numbers in descending order from the left stack to the right while making sure we don't place a bigger number after a smaller one (prompt will be given for invalid move)
